<p>
The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways.<br>
They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately moblie; and an<br>
isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They have long legs that, because they tack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still. (from<br>
Wikipedia)
